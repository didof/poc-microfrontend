# PoC MicroFrontEnd

In the root folder just run

`npm run dev`

Or deep dive into the folders and for each use the same command.

## Current MFE

- Container [`React`]
  - Products [`React`]

## Todo

1. Implement production webpack configurations.
2. Add a `Vue`-based microfrontend.
3. Update webpack configurations to manage css, upload, etc.
